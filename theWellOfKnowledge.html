					Inside the well, there is endless knowledge. The deeper you go into the well, the deeper knowledge you can obtain . . .<br><br>
					The well is dedicated to empowering users with free, open-source knowledge. Yes, that's right. Free. But not necessarily "free" in the monetary sense. More precisely, the well means "free" in the "freedom" sense. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					All across this site, you'll find free knowledge about cybersecurity. You can utilize this knowledge in your real life.

				<h2>There are 5 main different types of cybersecurity, that anyone should be conscious of in this day and age</h2>
				<ol class="well ol">
					<li class="well li">
						<span class="well li span">1.) Critical Infrastructure Security:</span>
						<p class="well li p">
							This type of security consists of the physical information system devices, which virtually every modern society now relies on.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="well li">
						<span class="well li span">2.) Application Security:</span>
						<p class="well li p">
							Application security is a critical security measure to protect systems. Application security, or appsec for short, uses a combination of software and hardware methods, in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with external threats.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="well li">
						<span class="well li span">3.) Network Security:</span>
						<p class="well li p">
							A personal favorite of mine, as I am currently working in the networking field. Network security involves the mitigations of threats external to the network itself.
						</p>
						<p class="well li p">
							Personally, I consider this sub-field of cybersecurity extremely important. By protecting the infrastructure of internal networks and inhibiting access, netsec guards what's essentially the first line of defense of a computing device, which is typically the network with which the computer is associated.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="well li">
						<span class="well li span">4.) Cloud Security:</span>
						<p class="well li p">
							A sub-field of cybersecurity that has been slowly growing relatively recently. Cloud security involves the protection of data in cloud resources. Cloudsec is implemented via software-based security tools and are typically provided by cloud providers.
						</p>
						<p class="well li p">
							As cloud computing is increasing in popularity, cloudsec is also growing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="well li">
						<span class="well li span">5.) Internet of Things (IoT) Security:</span>
						<p class="well li p">
							IoT refers to the family of devices know as "Internet of Things." This family consists of digital-based devices that are Internet-capable, and are also appliances. Examples are TVs, refrigerators, wifi routers, printers, cameras, Amazon's Alexa, etc . . .
