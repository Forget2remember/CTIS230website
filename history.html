				<p class="history content p">
					The world changed in 1943. This is when the world saw its first digital computer, back in the days of the ENIAC, UNIVAC, and the rest of the massive, room-engulfing, metal behemoths. Cyberthreats during this time was extremely limited, partically since ownership and access to these machines were limited. However, in 1949, John von Neumann was the first to publicly speculate that computer programs could reproduce. And with this, he introduced the theory of computer viruses.
				</p>
				<p class="history content p">
					In the 1950s, a practice known as "phone phreaking" emerged. To put it simply, phone phreakers were (and still are) people who exploit vulnerabilities in telecom-engineers-based, phone protocols that allow the engineers to make free calls during their work. Sound confusing? Well, that's because it is! The telephone companies didn't have a way of stopping the phone phreakers, so the practice continued until around the 80s, where it eventually died out.
				</p>
				<p class="history content p">
					Throughout the 60s, access to the mega machines was limited only to a select few. Mainframes existed at universities, with professors and students having access. Actually during this age, students were the people most interested in hacking. The difference, students were simply curious, fun-seekers. This is a totally opposite concept from the malicious, profit-driven hackers, that we see today in the modern world.
				</p>
				<p class="history content p">
					The "sport" grew so popular, that in 1967, IBM invited students to try to test their (then new) computer. The students were able to learn the system's language, and gained unauthorized access to other parts of the system. Truly incredible!
				</p>
				<p class="history content p">
					Throughout the 70s, computers became smaller, and their price tags began shrinking. The large, clunky systems humans were accustomed to at that time, were shifting towards a new design! Specifically, data-storage technologies were changing, along with a concept known as computer networking. During the 70s, the United States Department of Defense invented the ARPANET. These new changes are what really brought cybersecurity to the frontlines.
				</p>
				<p class="history content p">
					One of the earliest security researchers, Bob Thomas, created a computer program called Crepper, that could traverse ARPANET's network. In doing so, it would leave a trace of itself. This was countered by a program called Reaper, by Ray Tomlinson, which traced down and deleted Creeper. Thus, antivirus software was born. Reaper was also the first implementing of a computer worm, as it was a self-replicating program.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of this sparked the field, that we all now know as "cybersecurity." As digital technologies have developed over time, the attack surface of these technologies has increased as well. It is up to security researchers to map attack surfaces, and create solutions to mitigate the ways that adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities.
